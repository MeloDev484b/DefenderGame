# Defender Game
Defender Game is a text-based strategy game in which the player is tasked with managing the fate of a kingdom. 

Enemies are randomly generated and it is the player's job to determine how many soldiers should be stationed at a position in order to execute a successful defense.
If the player's army can eliminate enough enemy soldiers, they will be **routed** and the player will take **prisoners** that can be sold at a later time.

The player is able to use **diplomacy** to avoid or alter a conflict. 

Before combat, a variety of **random events** can occur and will either grant a boon or result in a tactical disadvantage.

The player's **score** is calculated based on factors such as enemy soldiers killed, succsessful trades, successful diplomacy, and how many **arms** the king has grown over the entirety of the game. 

Thank you for playing Defender Game.

The intent of this project was to practice the development process and to help me internalize basic programming principles. I enjoyed practicing C++ and look forward to learning more.
